## QR codes

When the assets are registered in Nevermined, the assets will be available in the Metadata API:

```
https://metadata.keyko.rocks/api/v1/metadata/assets/ddo/did%3Anv%3A1234
```

Using each URL, we should be able to generate a QR code. Each QR code to use during the demo
should be copied to the `resources/qr/` directory.
