*Pertains to XSDS.zip and Data Dump.xml*

Hereby the specifications of the AWB (CargoXML FWB) and HWB (CargoXML XFZB) and a small dataset for the hackathon.

In the zip file, the files Waybill_1.xsd and HouseWaybill_1.xsd will give an overview of the messages.

The other files are additions, if you would like to see more specifications.

 

The AWB and HWB messages contain the necessary shipment data that we need to transport a shipment.

The AWB is the contract between KLM and the forwarder (so no customer/ shipper information is in this).

The HWB is the contract between the forwarder and the customer/shipper.

In future it would be great to find a way to get the blockchain reference in the AWB and HWB.

So we can use that reference to call the block chain for verification of the shipment throughout the supply chain.

Good luck for the last weeks/days!
